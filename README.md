In order to make a collision detection system, all satellites were calibrated to the same radio channel, 10, in order to not interfere with any other micro:bits. Our micro:satellites don’t use the LED’s, therefore save power by not using the display, as well as only emitting a signal at set intervals, not too rapidly, which means that power is not constantly being used. Each satellite used radio frequency to detect whenever another satellite was within 1m of another satellite. Each satellite would play a different sound whenever it was nearby another satellite, which allowed us to determine which satellites were close to which. 

Our micro:sat code successfully works as a collision detection system and is available on Github under an open-source licence.
